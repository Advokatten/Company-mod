  company_ikea: "IKEA" # Founded in 1943, same as norsk jernverk i just cba finding a single factory making furniture because its almost no information out ther on names only that it existed in places like Bodafors, Småland & Sjuhäradsbygden, Norrköping
  company_ica: "Inköpscentralernas aktiebolag" # Founded 1938. Sweden did not have much of this shit in the 1800s but did import it apparently, im just gonna have this company exist almost 100 years early since its fun gameplay to have it possible as a company.
